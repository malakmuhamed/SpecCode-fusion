focus on four main features: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Requirements Extraction:
facilitate the automatic extraction of clear, actionable requirements from natural language documents
track changes to both the SRS and source code, ensuring that all modifications are synchronized
provide continuous feedback on compatibility status
identify missing or incompatible elements between the SRS and source code, offering actionable
help developers state the
not only enhance the grading process but also
provide a less error-prone environment
streamline the compatibility checks between SRS and source code, ultimately enhancing
provide a compatibility verification feature to automatically check the alignment between Software Requirements
provide a requirements extraction feature that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically extract
provide an automated reporting feature that continuously generates real-time reports on the compatibility status
provide a feedback mechanism feature that delivers continuous, real-time feedback on the alignment between the
